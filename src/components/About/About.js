				I am Raton Chandro Roy and completed my honours in physics from SUST. Now I am studying for a master's in information technology which remains under the IICT institute of SUST. I am trying to develop my career in the IT sector. That is why I am trying to learn to code whenever I get the opportunity. I want to build my career as a web developer thatâ€™s why I enroll in this course. Next three months I want to continue my learning on react, node, and mongodb. After completing this course properly I want to do a remote job as a front-end web developer.
